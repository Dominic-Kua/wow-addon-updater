# wow addon update script
A script to update all my addons with a single command.

<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/F6YleIb.gif"></center>

## what it does
As of now, the script
* checks for updates, downloads and extracts files synchronously
* reads and writes a configuration file
* saves downloaded files to a cache folder
* scrapes relevant information from Curseforge using bs4 (because I'm an idiot and
    thats all I could come up with)
* bypasses cloudflare ddos protection (IUAM) pages 
* determines available upgrades based on upload time of the latest file on Curseforge
* only downloads addons for one game flavor (classic or retail)

## what you need
### requirements
This requires at least python 3.6 (because f-strings) to run and depends on the packages [`bs4`](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/),
[`cfscrape`](https://github.com/Anorov/cloudflare-scrape) (build on [`requests`](https://github.com/psf/requests)), [`colorama`](https://github.com/tartley/colorama)
and [`tqdm`](https://tqdm.github.io/). So either install these via your package manager or do a quick
```
$ pip3 install --user bs4 cfscrape colorama tqdm
```

`cfscrape` also requires [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) 10 or higher to solve Cloudflare's JavaScript challenges.

### configuration file
The configuration file must be in the same directory as the script. It [follows the structure
of INI-files](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#supported-ini-file-structure) and
contains three sections. The path to you game installation folder and the WoW version you want to
update addons for should go under`[settings]`. Under `[classic]` and `[retail]` you put the
names of the addons that you want to keep up-to-date. There is one section for each version of the game
right now. 

#### addon names
The name of an addon is currently the project name from its Curseforge URL.
If you want an addon to be tracked and updated, you have to look it up on 
Curseforge and copy the last part of the project url.

For example, let's say the addon you want to track is called "<i>T.H.I.S. Addon</i>"
then the project url is probably going to be something like `.../wow/addons/this-addon`.
Now, we are going to copy `this-addon` and paste it into the configuration file.

#### example configuration

```ini
[settings]
version=classic
game directory=D:/games/World of Warcraft

[retail]
details
big-wigs
prat-3-0
weakauras-2

[classic]
details
classiccastbars
classicthreatmeter
real-mob-health
```

### execution
Call the script like
```
$ python3 update_wow_addons.py
```
and it should just workâ„¢.

## to do
* [ ] make code cleaner and more sophisticated i guess?
* [ ] automatically determine installed addons
* [x] test if this even works on other machines
* [ ] maybe make it a full fledged cli application?
* [x] read and write configuration file(s) instead of hardcoding stuff into the script
* [ ] add option to always check updates for both game versions
